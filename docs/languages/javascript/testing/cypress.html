The GUI is a mode built specifically to run one or a small number of tests at a time.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>you can tell Cypress to cleanup snapshots by setting the <code>{ numTestsKeptInMemory: 0 }</code> in <code>cypress.json</code>. This will purge snapshots aggressively but then you will lose the ability to debug any of your tests.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>If you want to run all your tests you need to do it from the command line using <code>cypress run</code>.

Embedded in Protractor, Nightwatch, …</p> <p>At that time, all the webapp were simple and staless (full page refresh at each user action). Javascript was not to<br>build webapp but to decorate existing webapp. Most of the code was synchronous. Nowadays, there is SPA, stateful,<br>no page refresh and everything is asynchronous.</p> <p>Selenium original flaw is : it is a stateless http API. It is impossible to test effectively a stateful app with<br>a stateless API. Selenium cannot know and show a particular state at a particular moment.</p> <p>This forces dev to build tests (e2e) after everything is built (impossible to TDD)</p> <p><strong>How cypress solves the problem ?</strong></p> <p>Part 1: Setup</p> <pre><code>npm install -g cypress-cli &amp;&amp; npm install cypress

cypress open</code></pre><p>You are done. You can write your first test.</p> <p>Part 2: Writing</p> <p>Working on reporting, when a assertion pass, and when it fail. Lot’s of information for the developer.</p> <p>Snapshoting : Every command ran by cypress takes a snapshot of the DOM. You can open your dev tools and check<br>the logs pushed by cypress with the state of the app.</p> <p>Events : They are captured during execution an logged into the console.</p> <p>Frameworks : Cypress is built on top of <a href="https://mochajs.orhtml">Mocha</a>, <a href="http://chaijs.cohtml">Chai</a> and <a href="http://sinonjs.orhtml">Sinon</a>.</p> <p>Async : Mostly hidden, each command return promise under the hood.</p> <p>Hooks : <code>onBeforeLoad</code> hook for <code>cy.visit</code> command allows developer to : open the browser debugger, alter the global<br>state of the app (for example by injecting user info or tokens).<br>You can stub server responses (very nice to tests error messages and related ui behavior)</p> <p>Part 3: Management</p> <p>CI related. When a test suite will be ran in a CI provider (TravisCI for ex), output will be sent to cypress,<br>then cypress will sent it back to cypress desktop app.</p> <p>Can output logs, screenshots, even video of the suite</p> <p>Ability to remote connect to the CI to see and manage the suite run.</p> <p><strong>Goals for cypress</strong></p> <ul> <li>Open Source</li> <li>Champions</li> <li>Documentation</li> <li>Happiness</li> </ul> <p><strong>Roadmap</strong></p> <p>They are only 5. They have raised some money. Not all repo are opensource now.</p> <p><strong>Questions</strong></p> <p>Not supporting IE right now, it will. (Brian thinks crossbrowser testing is going down because there is less and less<br>difference between browsers).</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBhHsYlF4html">Jack Franklin, Testing React Applications : React Amsterdam 2016</a></p> </article></body></html>
