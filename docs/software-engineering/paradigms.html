<p>In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program’s state.</p>
<p>Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is a programming paradigm […] that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.</p>
<p>Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side effects by describing what the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain, rather than describe how to accomplish it as a sequence of the programming language primitives (the how being left up to the language’s implementation). This is in contrast with imperative programming, which implements algorithms in explicit steps.</p>

<p>don’t use unrestrained GOTO (Robert C. Martin)</p>
<p>aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of subroutines, block structures, for and while loops—in contrast to using simple tests and jumps such as the go to statement which could lead to “spaghetti code” causing difficulty to both follow and maintain.</p>

<p>N.B. : An <strong>expression</strong> is not a <strong>statement</strong> but a valid unit of code that <em>resolves to a value</em>. Not all <strong>statements</strong> resolve to a value.</p>
<p>N.B.2. :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Functional programming (FP) helps you write robust, powerful, and maintainable programs well suited to multicore and cloud computing by focusing on controlling state and effects.</p>
<p><strong>Functional Programming Principles</strong></p>
<p><em>Own Your Context with Explicit State</em><br>Some people call it “stateless”, but I prefer “explicit state”. Instead of having data implicitly “somewhere over there” and reading that (implicit &amp; shared) data while in the body of a function, simply pass all data that the function needs explicitly as arguments.</p>
<p><em>Limit Side Effects</em><br>This is the output side of explicit state. As much as possible, avoid talking to the world outside of the function, except for the final return of the function.</p>
<p><em>Referential Transparency</em><br>When you limit yourself to simple input/output for every function (with no changes to the world outside it), you can swap out a function for its return value.</p>
<p><em>Composition</em><br>With (top-down) inheritance, you specialize a general class into more specific subsets. For example, a general Car class can be used to make more specific SportsCar and Minivan classes. This works well for a certain problems, but fails when you want to mix and match functionality. You can quickly end up with an endless regress of more and more general classes, and huge messaging interfaces between different parts of your application.<br>With (bottom-up) function composition, we take small, single responsibility functions, and combine them with other functions to build up larger, more complex behaviours. We do this either by passing the result of one function as the argument of another, or by calling them in sequence (if we’re side-effecting).</p>

We should because:<br>1) Functional programs are simpler - which makes them easier to write and maintain<br>2) There’s no temporal coupling - no worrying if some function was called before another function.<br>3) Fewer concurrency issues. In a purely functional program, there’s no concurrency because there is no state.<br>4) No asking, “What’s the state?”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zlp9rKHGD4&t=2318s">38:38</a> We’re using multicore CPU’s now because we can’t increase clock rate anymore.

So individual cores slow down but the chip throughput goes up if you can take advantage of all the cores.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zlp9rKHGD4&t=2520s">42:00</a> How are you going to work with an abundance of cores? Maybe we need to walk away from the assignment statement.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>don’t use pointers to functions (Robert C. Martin) (He is talking about pointers in C++)</p>
<p>based on the concept of “objects”, which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object’s procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of “this” or “self”). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.</p>

<ul>
<li>When do you choose functional programming over object oriented?</li>
</ul>
<p>TDLR : If logic evolves more then the model : choose FP and if model evolves more then the logic : choose OOP</p>
<p>OOP is good when you have a fixed set of <em>operations</em> on <em>things</em>.
Your code evolves, you primarily add new <em>things</em>. Adding new classes which implement existing methods (<em>operations</em>).</p>
<p>FP is good when you have a fixed set of <em>things</em><br>Your code evolves, you primarily add new <em>operations</em> (functions) on existing <em>things</em> (data types).</p>
<p>When evolution goes the wrong way, you have problems (<a href="http://www.daimi.au.dk/~madst/tool/papers/expression.txt">The Expression Problem : Philip Wadler 19981112</a>):</p>
<p>Adding a new operation to an OOP program may require editing many class definitions to add a new method.</p>
<p>Adding a new kind of thing to a FP program may require editing many function definitions to add a new case.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the typical problem definitions where functional programming is a better choice?</li>
</ul>
<p>Functional languages excel at manipulating symbolic data in tree form.</p>
