There are various kinds of double that Gerard lists:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Dummy objects</strong> are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill parameter lists.</li> <li><strong>Fake objects</strong> actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (an InMemoryTestDatabase is a good example).</li> <li><strong>Stubs</strong> provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what’s programmed in for the test.</li> <li><strong>Spies</strong> are stubs that also record some information based on how they were called. One form of this might be an email service that records how many messages it was sent.</li> <li><strong>Mocks</strong> are pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive. They can throw an exception if they receive a call they don’t expect and are checked during verification to ensure they got all the calls they were expecting.</li> </ul> <h3 id="title-mock-vs-stub">mock vs stub</h3> <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/271513html">What’s the difference between a mock &amp; stub? - stackoverflow.com</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Here’s a description of each one followed by with real world sample.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Dummy</strong> - just bogus values to satisfy the <code>API</code>.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p><em>Example:</em> If you’re testing a method of a class which requires many mandatory parameters in a constructor which <em>have no effect</em> on your test, then you may create dummy objects for the purpose of creating new instances of a class.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Fake</strong> - create a test implementation of a class which may have a dependency on some external infrastructure. (It’s good practice that your unit test does <strong>NOT</strong> actually interact with external infrastructure.)</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p><em>Example:</em> Create fake implementation for accessing a database, replace it with <code>in-memory</code> collection.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Stub</strong> - override methods to return hard-coded values, also referred to as <code>state-based</code>.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p><em>Example:</em> Your test class depends on a method <code>Calculate()</code> taking 5 minutes to complete. Rather than wait for 5 minutes you can replace its real implementation with stub that returns hard-coded values; taking only a small fraction of the time.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Mock</strong> - very similar to <code>Stub</code> but <code>interaction-based</code> rather than <code>state-based</code>. This means you don’t expect from <code>Mock</code> to return some value, but to assume that specific order of method calls are made.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p><em>Example:</em> You’re testing a user registration class. After calling <code>Save</code>, it should call <code>SendConfirmationEmail</code>.</p> </blockquote> <p><code>Stubs</code> and <code>Mocks</code> are actually sub types of <code>Mock</code>, both swap real implementation with test implementation, but for different, specific reasons.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="title-mock-vs-spy">mock vs spy</h3> <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12827580/mocking-vs-spying-in-mocking-frameworhtml">mocking vs spying</a></p> <h3 id="title-test-driven-development-tdd">Test Driven Development (TDD)</h3> <p>A TDD cycle is composed of three, iterative phases.</p> <ul> <li>Red: Write a unit test; the unit test fails.</li> <li>Green: Write production code; the unit test passes.</li> <li>Refactor: Refactor the code [11]; the unit test passes.</li> </ul> <p><a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.hthtml">The Cycles of TDD : blog.cleancoder.com (2014/12)</a></p> <p><a href="https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2013/03/06/ThePragmaticsOfTDD.hthtml">The Pragmatics of TDD : 8thlight.com (2013/03)</a></p> <p><a href="https://wakeupcode.wordpress.com/2017/02/06/getting-early-feedback-applying-test-driven-developmenhtml">Getting early feedback applying Test-Driven Development</a></p> <blockquote> <p>from a Pivotal Labs developer (Jasmine)<br>he links searches papers by <a href="http://proceedings.informingscience.org/InSITE2012/InSITE12p165-187Bulajic0052.phtml">IBM</a><br>and <a href="https://zeroturnaround.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10.1.1.104.6319.phtml">Microsoft</a><br>They concludes :<br>Reduced defect density at IBM 40% and Microsoft 60% – 90%<br>Increase of time taken to code feature (15% – 35%)<br><strong>TDD saves time &amp; money</strong></p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/TDDpaperv8.phtml">Paper from North Carolina State University created by Boby George and Laurie Williams in 2003</a></p> <blockquote> <p>This document demonstrates that the studied group of TDD practitioners spent only 16% more time on the overall development process</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/2013/05/my-unit-testing-epiphanhtml">My unit testing epiphany - www.stevefenton.co.uk - Steve Fenton - 20130501</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Following Ian Cooper famous talk “TDD: Where did it all go wrong?”.</p> <p>Writing a test class for an impl class implies :</p> <ul> <li>over-isolation (mocking everything)</li> <li>testing impl instead of behaviour</li> </ul> <p>The <em>red-green-refactor</em> cycle have to be precised :</p> <ul> <li>Red: Write a unit test; the unit test fails.</li> <li>Green: Write production code; the unit test passes. <em>Returning a hardcoded value is too simplistic.

Green. Refactor.</p> <p>Red. You write a test that represents the behaviour that is needed from the system.</p> <p>Green. You write minimal code to make the test green.</p> <p>Refactor. This is the only time you should add design.</p> <p>When you do this right, you end up with several classes that are all tested by a single test-class. This is how things should be. <em>The tests document the requirements of the system with minimal knowledge of the implementation. The implementation could be One Massive Function or it could be a bunch of classes</em>.</p> <p>Ian points out that you cannot refactor if you have implementation details in your tests because by definition, refactoring is where you change implementation details and not the public interface or the tests.</p> <p><strong>Ports and adapters</strong></p> <p>Ian suggests that one way to test behaviours rather than implementation details is to use a <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architectuhtml">ports and adapters architecture</a> and test via the ports.</p> <p>There is another video where he provides some <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5744-decoupling-from-asp-net-hexagonal-architectures-in-nhtml">more concrete examples of what he means</a>.</p> <p><strong>Mocking</strong></p> <p>One side effect of having unit tests for every method/class is that you are then trying to mock out every collaborator of every object and that necessarily means that you are trying to mock implementation details.</p> <p>Using mocks of implementation details significantly increases the fragility of tests reducing their effectiveness.</p> <p>Mocks still have their place (systems I/O)</p> <p><strong>Problems with higher level unit tests</strong></p> <ul> <li>Complex implementation<br>One of the questions that was raised and answered in Ian’s presentation was about what to do when the code you are implementing to make a high-level unit test test pass is really complex and you find yourself needing more guidance.</li> <li>Combinatorial explosion<br>I’ve covered this comprehensively in the <a href="http://robdmoore.id.au/blog/2015/01/26/review-of-j-b-rainsberger-integrated-tests-are-a-scahtml">previous article</a>. This can be a serious problem, but as per the previous section in those instances just write the lower-level tests.</li> <li>Complex tests<br>The other point that Ian raised is that you are interacting with more objects this might mean there is more you need to set up in your tests, which then make the arrange section of the tests harder to understand and maintain and reducing the advantage of writing the tests in the first place. </li> <li>Multiple test failures<br>It’s definitely possible that you can cause multiple tests to fail by changing one thing.</li> <li>Shared code gets tested twice<br>that’s fine because that shared code is an implementation detail </li> </ul> </blockquote> <p><a href="http://robdmoore.id.au/blog/2015/01/26/review-of-j-b-rainsberger-integrated-tests-are-a-scahtml">Review of: J.B.
