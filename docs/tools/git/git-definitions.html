<h3 id="title-repository">repository</h3>
<p>Named also a <em>tree</em> by some git users.<br>It is the whole history of a project (a directory).<br>Composed by commits. Each node is a commit.<br>Created by <code>git init</code> command (or by <code>git clone</code> if you want to copy an existing repository).<br>Create a self-sufficient <code>.git</code> directory. It means that a simple zip on the repository root directory is enough to backup it.</p>
<h3 id="title-bare-repository">bare repository</h3>
<p>A repository created with <code>git init</code> command is for <strong>working</strong>.<br>A repository created with <code>git init --bare</code> command is for <strong>sharing</strong>.<br>A bare repository doesn’t contain a working directory nor a <code>.git</code> directory.<br>Github, gitlab, etc …, create a bare repository on their side.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.saintsjd.com/2011/01/what-is-a-bare-git-repository/">What is a bare git repository : www.saintsjd.com</a></p>
<p>Notice that you can add to your remote list a <code>non-bare</code> repository but you will not be able to push in it if the branch where<br>you want to push is checked out in it, git will deny the push (cause possible inconsistency).</p>
<p>It can be bypassed by setting the <code>receive.denyCurrentBranch</code> config variable in the receiver repo to <code>&#39;ignore&#39;</code> or <code>&#39;warn&#39;</code> but it is not recommended.</p>
<h3 id="title-working-directory">working directory</h3>
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/git-users/PVDjjQ5bE10">difference between working copy and working directory - groups.google.com - git-users</a></p>
<p>Litterally it is the directory where the user is working ;)</p>
<p>A <code>git status</code> on a working directory without any changes tracked by git output this :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>
<h3 id="title-remote">remote</h3>
<p>A remote is a distant repository (a repo on another computer).</p>
<h3 id="title-commit">commit</h3>
<p>Also named <em>revision</em>.<br>It is a state of a directory.<br>Each commit has one ore more parents commit.<br>Git stores only the difference between current commit state and parents. So a commit = current project state - parents.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd_UpJPDlik&index=88&list=PLTbQvx84FrAS5clN9i8_LFUQxcMY7qXAO">Comment faire un commit sans faire du Git (Alexandre Garnier) : Devoxx2016</a></p>
<h3 id="title-branch">branch</h3>
<p>A “branch” is an active line of development.<br>The most recent commit on a branch is referred to as the tip of that branch. The tip of the branch is referenced by a branch head, which moves forward as additional development is done on the branch.</p>
<h3 id="title-tag">tag</h3>
<p>A ref pointing to a tag or commit object. In contrast to a head, a tag is not changed by a commit.</p>
<h3 id="title-merge">merge</h3>
<p><code>git merge</code> is the action of merging a source branch in a destination branch.</p>
<p>If the destination branch have not diverged from the root of the source branch, the merge is a fast-forward.</p>
<pre><code>-- M1
    \            
     B1 - B2 - B3</code></pre><p>At the end, the two branches will points on the same commit.</p>
<pre><code>-- M1 - B1 - B2 - B3</code></pre><p>If the destination branch have diverged from the root of the source branch, </p>
<pre><code>-- M1 - M2 
    \            
     B1 - B2 - B3</code></pre><p>git will create a merge commit containing all the modifications.</p>
<pre><code>-- M1 - M2 - - - M3
    \            /
     B1 - B2 - B3</code></pre><h3 id="title-rebase">rebase</h3>
<p><code>git rebase</code> allows user to rewrite the history.</p>
<pre><code>-- M1 - M2 
    \            
     B1 - B2 - B3</code></pre><p>At this point, instead of merging, we can rewrite our branch history, the goal is to set the B1 parents to M2 instead of M1 :</p>
<pre><code>-- M1 - M2 
         \         
         B1 - B2 - B3</code></pre><p>Now we can run a fast-forward merge to keep a clean linear history :</p>
<pre><code>-- M1 - M2 - B1 - B2 - B3</code></pre><h3 id="title-fetch">fetch</h3>
<p><code>git fetch</code> is the action to update a given remote repository data locally. (you have a local occurrence of all the remote you have added to your remote list).</p>
<h3 id="title-pull">pull</h3>
<p><code>git pull &lt;remote-name&gt; &lt;branch-name&gt;</code> runs a <code>git fetch</code> on the given remote then a <code>git merge</code> on the local branch from the remote branch.</p>
<h3 id="title-push">push</h3>
<p>Obviously, write access is mandatory on the remote<br><code>git push &lt;remote-name&gt; &lt;branch-name&gt;</code> write the local branch commits on the remote branch.<br>The history must be clean enough to allow a fast forward or git will reject the push.</p>
<h3 id="title-range-operators">range operators</h3>
<p>Used mostly with <code>git log</code> and <code>git diff</code> commands. Provide a tool to compare branches and tags.</p>
<p>Difference depends on the command context. Log work with commits where diff work with commit content.</p>

<h4 id="title--dot-dot"><code>..</code> (dot dot)</h4>

<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ git diff A..B
# exactly the same as

# output only the commits in B that A doesn&#39;t have (compare from the root of the 2 branches)</code></pre>
<h3 id="title-ancestry-references">ancestry references</h3>
<p>Used in a lot of commands stuck with <code>HEAD</code> ref to points to ancestors commits.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2221658/whats-the-difference-between-head-and-head-in-git">What’s the difference between HEAD^ and HEAD~ in Git? : stackoverflow.com</a></p>
<ul>
<li><code>~</code> specifies ancestors</li>
<li><code>^</code> specifies parents</li>
</ul>
<p>Ancestors are related to the current branch.</p>
<p>A commit can have more then one parent, caret is used to select the parent.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have this tree :</p>
<pre><code>-- A1 - A2 - - - A3
    \            /
     B1 - B2 - B3</code></pre><p>where <code>HEAD</code> is <code>A3</code>.</p>
<h4 id="title--caret"><code>^</code> (caret)</h4>
<pre><code>HEAD^ is a shortand for HEAD^1
HEAD^=A2</code></pre><pre><code>HEAD^^ = HEAD^1^1 = A1</code></pre><pre><code>HEAD^2 = B3</code></pre><pre><code>HEAD^2^1 = B2</code></pre><pre><code>HEAD^2^2 = nothing as B3 has only one parent (B2)</code></pre><h4 id="title--tilde"><code>~</code> (tilde)</h4>
<pre><code>HEAD~ is a shortand for HEAD~1</code></pre><pre><code>HEAD~2 = A1</code></pre><pre><code>HEAD^2~2 = B1</code></pre></article></body></html>
