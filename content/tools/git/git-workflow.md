# git - workflow

## differents sources for brainstorming

The main important one, which is "devops compatible" : [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

## merging strategy

[Dilemne avec worklow git et intÃ©gration continue - www.developpez.net/forums - 2016](https://www.developpez.net/forums/d1599839/general-developpement/alm/usine-logicielle/dilemne-worklow-git-integration-continue/)

In a **CI strategy** you can merge in master at the start of the day to prevent painful merges at a later time.
In a **synchronization point strategy** you only merge in from well defined points in time, for example a tagged release.

### synchronization point strategy
Based on [an email from Linus Torvalds](https://www.mail-archive.com/dri-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg39091.html) about merging strategy for linux dev.

#### TLDR
Goals : I want clean history, but that really means (a) clean and (b) history.

##### clean
- People can (and probably should) rebase their _private_ trees (their own work). That's a _cleanup_.
- But never other peoples code. That's a "destroy history".

##### history
- Keep your own history readable
- Don't expose your crap.
- Don't merge _upstream_ (ie : pull) code at random points.
- Don't merge _downstream_ (ie : push) code at random points either.

### Continuous Integration strategy
Based on [Martin Fowler quotes](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html) in [gitlab documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/gitlab_flow.html#do-not-order-commits-with-rebase).
> If your feature branches commonly take more than a day of work, look into ways to create smaller units of work and/or use feature toggles.

##### pros
- merge your work every day
- pull others work every day
- CI oriented
- painless merge
- easier for devs to handle

##### cons
- feature flipping is mandatory to be able to deliver a clean product
- more difficult for dev to handle
