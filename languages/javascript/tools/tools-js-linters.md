## definition

[Lint (software) : en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))

> In computer programming, **lint** is a Unix utility that flags some suspicious and non-portable constructs (likely to be bugs) in C language source code; generically, lint or a **linter** is any tool that flags suspicious usage in software written in any computer language. The term **lint-like behavior** is sometimes applied to the process of flagging suspicious language usage. Lint-like tools generally perform static analysis of source code.
> 
> *Lint* as a term can also refer more broadly to syntactic discrepancies in general, especially in interpreted languages like JavaScript and Python. For example, modern lint checkers are often used to find code that doesn't correspond to certain style guidelines. Because these languages lack a compiling phase that shows a list of errors prior to execution, they can also be used as simple debuggers for common errors (showing syntactic discrepancies as errors) or hard to find errors such as heisenbugs (drawing attention on suspicious code as "possible errors").

**TLDR**

A linter performs static analysis of source code to find :

- undected errors on interpreted languages (they have no compiling phase)
- styleguide issues
