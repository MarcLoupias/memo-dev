> - Entry : An entry point indicates which module webpack should use to begin building out its internal *dependency graph*
> - Output : The output property tells webpack where to emit the *bundles* it creates and how to name these files.
> - Loaders : Loaders allow webpack to process other types of files (other then `.js`) and convert them into valid modules.
> - Plugins : Plugins can be leveraged to perform a wider range of tasks like bundle optimization, asset management and injection of environment variables.
