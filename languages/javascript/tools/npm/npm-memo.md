## npm 5

Features list

- better perfs
- save behavior in `package.json` when installing a package is reversed (saved by default, flag needed to not save)
- lockfile strategy changed with `package-lock.json` generated by default (behavior regarding to the registry is different then shrinkwrap)
- the deps tree is not displayed after a npm install, print a summary instead
- complete rewrite of the cache system. `npm cache clean` is must be run before using npm 5. new command `npm cache verify`, new options to tweak cache behavior (`--prefer-offline`, `--prefer-online` and `--offline`), concurrent access support.

## semver

[semver to manage scopes in package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver)
- [semver](https://github.com/mojombo/semver/blob/master/semver.md) : `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
- [caret range](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver#caret-ranges-1-2-3-0-2-5-0-0-4) keep major, change minor & patch
- [tilde range](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver#tilde-ranges-1-2-3-1-2-1) keep major & minor, only patch update

**Warning** 
semver interpretation for breaking changes can be slightly different from a package to another. The semver spec says that any breaking change must be traduced in a ++ on the major version number.
But libs like angularjs (or protractor) introduce breaking changes in minor update.
Consequences : ^ (caret) in package.json should allow automatic feature update without breaking changes but in fact it depends a lot on the package owner management.

## command list

```
# list globally installed package by name
npm -list -g <package_name>

# or for all packages
npm list -g -depth=0

# to get tree deps
npm list -g -depth=1
```

```
# list locally installed package by name
npm -list <package_name>
```

```
# view version on repository
npm view <package_name> version
```

```
# display npm config
npm config list -ls
```

## npm folders
[check this](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/folders)

TLDR :

- Local install (default): puts stuff in `./node_modules` of the current package root.
- Global install (with `-g`): puts stuff in `/usr/local` or wherever node is installed.
- Install it locally if you're going to `require()` it.
- Install it globally if you're going to run it on the command line.
- If you need both, then install it in both places, or use `npm link`.

## managing dependencies

### built-in commands

[`npm ls`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ls)

```
# list all the installed dependencies in stdout in a tree format
npm ls

# list all the installed dependencies in stdout in a tree format limited to the first level
# it must matches deps listed in package.json
npm ls --depth=0

# same as above but with the deps of deps in the tree
npm ls --depth=1

# print extended informations
npm ll
npm la
```

[`npm outdated`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/outdated)

```
# check the registry to see if any (or, specific) installed packages are currently outdated
npm outdated
```

### fixing deps

Since npm v5, the lockfile standard is no more shrinkwrap, it is now the `package-lock.json` file.

The big difference is that this file is generated automatically by npm when running the `install` command.

There is also big behavior differences regarding to the registry publication for packages.

`npm-shrinkwrap.json` is backwards-compatible with npm versions 2, 3, and 4, whereas `package-lock.json` is only recognized by npm 5+
