> For your question "Shouldn't I output the production files as part of the build process, and publish these as a versioned artifact with NPM": you could, but this is not what most people do. As long as your build process is repeatable, there is no reason to package and publish the built version of your app. I am assuming here that your are building an application and not a reusable library in which case it would be a different story.

## npm 5

Features list

- better perfs
- save behavior in `package.json` when installing a package is reversed (saved by default, flag needed to not save)
- lockfile strategy changed with `package-lock.json` generated by default (behavior regarding to the registry is different then shrinkwrap)
- the deps tree is not displayed after a npm install, print a summary instead
- complete rewrite of the cache system. `npm cache clean` is must be run before using npm 5. new command `npm cache verify`, new options to tweak cache behavior (`--prefer-offline`, `--prefer-online` and `--offline`), concurrent access support.

### npm 5.1

- [`npm ls` shows all deps even missing ones](https://twitter.com/maybekatz/status/880446509547794437)
- `npm-package.lock` syncs when running `npm install <package-name>`

### npm 5.2

[blog.npmjs.org](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/162844303435/v520-2017-07-05)

- [npx added](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b), used to replace `npm run-script` command. Associated with the new [`node` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node), you can run a package against a specific node version.

### npm 5.3

[blog.npmjs.org](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/162986246605/v530-2017-07-13)

lots of npx fixes

### npm 5.4

[blog.npmjs.org](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/164504728630/v540-2017-08-22)

- new "did you mean" feature on CLI when making spelling mistakes on the commands
- `npx` fixes for Windows platform

### npm 5.5

- new security features for the registry (2 factors auth, tokens, ...)

### npm 5.6

[blog.npmjs.org](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/167963735925/v560-2017-11-27)

- ability to generate `package-lock.json` without running `npm install`
- fix npm and node9

### npm 5.7

[blog.npmjs.org](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/171139955345/v570)

- `npm install` will automatically resolve `git merge` conflicts in `package-lock.json` and `npm-shrinwrap.json` files. cf [doc](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/e27674c221dc17473f23bffa50123e49a021ae34)
- new `npm ci` command. Install from lock file only and so report errors when a dep is not fixed. `node_modules` are always rewritten to achieve that.

### npm 5.8

[blog.npmjs.org](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/171813275740/v580-next0)

- detect-newline (no more `LF` by default)
- [`NO_COLOR`](http://no-color.org/) standard support through var env
- `NO_PROXY` support through CLI with `--no-proxy`
- better env var support for `.npmrc` ([cf PR](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/18426))
- better error msg for `JSON parse error` and `EPERM/EACCES`
- `npm ci` fix and perf work

## semver

[semver to manage scopes in package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver)
- [semver](https://github.com/mojombo/semver/blob/master/semver.md) : `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
- [caret range](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver#caret-ranges-1-2-3-0-2-5-0-0-4) keep major, change minor & patch
- [tilde range](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver#tilde-ranges-1-2-3-1-2-1) keep major & minor, only patch update

**Warning** 
semver interpretation for breaking changes can be slightly different from a package to another. The semver spec says that any breaking change must be traduced in a ++ on the major version number.
But libs like angularjs (or protractor) introduce breaking changes in minor update.
Consequences : ^ (caret) in package.json should allow automatic feature update without breaking changes but in fact it depends a lot on the package owner management.

## command list

```
# list globally installed package by name
npm -list -g <package_name>

# or for all packages
npm list -g -depth=0

# to get tree deps
npm list -g -depth=1
```

```
# list locally installed package by name
npm -list <package_name>
```

```
# view version on repository
npm view <package_name> version
```

```
# display npm config
npm config list -ls
```

### testing packages locally

[The magic behind npm link](https://medium.com/trisfera/the-magic-behind-npm-link-d94dcb3a81af)

[Node.js — How to test your new NPM module without publishing it every 5 minutes - updated 201804](https://medium.com/@the1mills/how-to-test-your-npm-module-without-publishing-it-every-5-minutes-1c4cb4b369be)

## npm folders

[check this](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/folders)

TLDR :

- Local install (default): puts stuff in `./node_modules` of the current package root.
- Global install (with `-g`): puts stuff in `/usr/local` or wherever node is installed.
- Install it locally if you're going to `require()` it.
- Install it globally if you're going to run it on the command line.
- If you need both, then install it in both places, or use `npm link`.

## managing dependencies

### built-in commands

[`npm ls`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ls)

```
# list all the installed dependencies in stdout in a tree format
npm ls

# list all the installed dependencies in stdout in a tree format limited to the first level
# it must matches deps listed in package.json
npm ls --depth=0

# same as above but with the deps of deps in the tree
npm ls --depth=1

# print extended informations
npm ll
npm la
```

[`npm outdated`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/outdated)

```
# check the registry to see if any (or, specific) installed packages are currently outdated
npm outdated
```

### fixing deps

Since npm v5, the lockfile standard is no more shrinkwrap, it is now the `package-lock.json` file.

The big difference is that this file is generated automatically by npm when running the `install` command.

There is also big behavior differences regarding to the registry publication for packages.

`npm-shrinkwrap.json` is backwards-compatible with npm versions 2, 3, and 4, whereas `package-lock.json` is only recognized by npm 5+

[What is the difference between npm-shrinkwrap.json and package-lock.json? - stackoverflow.com - 20170530](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44258235/what-is-the-difference-between-npm-shrinkwrap-json-and-package-lock-json)

### understanding peer dependencies

[docs.npmjs.com - package.json - peerdependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies)

> you want to express the compatibility of your package with a host tool or library, while not necessarily doing a `require` of this host

```
{
  "name": "tea-latte",
  "version": "1.3.5",
  "peerDependencies": {
    "tea": "2.x"
  }
}
```

> This ensures your package tea-latte can be installed *along* with the second major version of the host package tea only.

> This leads to

```
├── tea-latte@1.3.5
└── tea@2.2.0
```

> instead of 

```
├── tea-latte@1.3.5
   └── tea@2.2.0
```

> since npm@3, npm is not installing automatically peerDeps. You need to add it explicitly in your package.json.

**peerDeps usage**

Mostly for a package to be used as a deps for another. No usage for an end project (like a frontend or a backend).

### others packages

- [npm-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check)
> Check for outdated, incorrect, and unused dependencies.

- [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates)
> Find newer versions of dependencies than what your package.json or bower.json allows

- [npm-remote-ls](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-remote-ls)
> Examine a package's dependency graph before you install it
