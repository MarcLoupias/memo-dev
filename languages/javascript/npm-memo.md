### semver

[semver to manage scopes in package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver)
- [semver](https://github.com/mojombo/semver/blob/master/semver.md) : `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
- [caret range](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver#caret-ranges-1-2-3-0-2-5-0-0-4) keep major, change minor & patch
- [tilde range](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver#tilde-ranges-1-2-3-1-2-1) keep major & minor, only patch update

**Warning** 
semver interpretation for breaking changes can be slightly different from a package to another. The semver spec says that any breaking change must be traduced in a ++ on the major version number.
But libs like angularjs (or protractor) introduce breaking changes in minor update.
Consequences : ^ (caret) in package.json should allow automatic feature update without breaking changes but in fact it depends a lot on the package owner management.


### command list

```
# list globally installed package by name
npm -list -g <package_name>
```

```
# list locally installed package by name
npm -list <package_name>
```

```
# view version on repository
npm view <package_name> version
```

```
# display npm config
npm config list -ls
```

### npm folders
[check this](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/folders)

TLDR :

- Local install (default): puts stuff in `./node_modules` of the current package root.
- Global install (with `-g`): puts stuff in `/usr/local` or wherever node is installed.
- Install it locally if you're going to `require()` it.
- Install it globally if you're going to run it on the command line.
- If you need both, then install it in both places, or use `npm link`.

### managing dependencies

- [npm-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check)
> Check for outdated, incorrect, and unused dependencies.

- [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates)
> Find newer versions of dependencies than what your package.json or bower.json allows

- [npm-remote-ls](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-remote-ls)
> Examine a package's dependency graph before you install it
