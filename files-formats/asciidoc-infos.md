> 1. A mature[1], plain-text writing format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, 
> slide decks, blog posts, man pages and more.
> 2. A text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various formats (called backends), 
> including HTML, DocBook, PDF and ePub[2].
>
> [1] AsciiDoc is over a decade old. It was first introduced in 2002.
> 
> [2] There are two implementations of the AsciiDoc processor. The original processor, named AsciiDoc, is written in 
> Python. A more modern implementation, named Asciidoctor, is written in Ruby.
