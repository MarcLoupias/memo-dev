[How I stay up-to-date as a Developer : hackernoon.com](https://hackernoon.com/how-do-i-stay-up-to-date-as-a-developer-5ec773e30a82)

[Web Development in 2017](https://medium.com/@Hisako1337/web-development-in-2017-e106ec18662)

> - Frontend Development
>   - the ["App" model is on the decline](https://www.b2bmarketing.net/en-gb/resources/news/mobile-app-usage-significant-decline)
>   - technology and ecosystem is there now for ambitious SPA frontends
>   - 3 major frameworks (Vue.js, React and Angular)
>   - frontend can then compile it into native mobile apps 
> 
> - Backend Development
>   - scale up and down on demand ([swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/))
>   - [serverless](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html), or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)
> 
> - Language Choices
>   - Javascript nowadays is not merely a language, but the web application platform
>   - plenty of languages to choose from, all of them transpiling to javascript at the end of the day
>   - NoSQL document db are rising because they are just json-storage in the eyes of backend dev and it is a lot easier
>   to manage then LAMP stacks
>   
> - The Future
>   - a single team of node.js backend developers can satisfy all your backend needs
>   - still can’t fully believe it by myself (used to hate javascript, loving Elixir and Rust), but I must reiterate it 
>   again: JS has won
